# ft_printf
*Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough*

## Introduction
Recode of printf from the C standard library. Learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. This function will be reused in future 42 projects.

## Outline
This ft_printf project is designed with bonuses in mind from the start, structs will be used to store attributes of flags. ft_printf will work with the following flags and specifiers.

* Specifiers

| Specifier | Output |
| :-------: | :---------: |
| ``c`` | Character |
| ``s`` | String |
| ``d``,``i`` | Integer |
| ``p`` | Pointer address in hexadecimal |
| ``u`` | Unsigned integer |
| ``x`` | Unsigned hexadecimal integer (lowecase) |
| ``X`` | Unsigned hexadecimal integer (uppercase) |
| ``%`` | The % character |

* Flags (Bonus)

| Flag | Description |
| :--: | :---------: |
| (width) | The minimum width of the printed conversion |
| (precision) | The minimum number of characters in the printed conversion |
| ``-`` | Left aligns the printed conversion |
| ``0`` | Pads printed conversion with zeroes instead of spaces |
| ``.`` | Separates the width and precision variables |
| ``#`` | Prepends 0x or 0X to hexadecimal coversions |
| `` `` | A blank is placed before a positive number produced by a signed conversion |
| ``+`` | Places a sign (+ or -) before a number produced by a signed conversion|
